Answer: x == 3

Greeter g2 is set to null in the first if-block.
Even though both greeters have the same name,
the != operator compares their references
instead of their values. Since they are different
objects with their own addresses in memory, the
condition in the if-statement is true.

Because g2 is set to null, a NullPointerException
is thrown when the code tries to call g2.sayHello().
Thus, x begins as 0, is set to 1 right before
the method call that throws the exception, is
incremented to 2 in the catch-block, and is
incremented to 3 in the finally-block.
